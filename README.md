1)
  -Project name: Basic Hangman Game
  -Team name: Super Stickman
  -Name: Gwen Lacovic

2) Describe project:
  - I am trying to build a basic hangman game that will display
a stickman figure, the number of incorrect guesses, and guessed letters with the use of a GUI.
  - I chose this project type because it interested me the most of the example list, 
and I started thinking of what potential ways the game could be set up or look like.
  - I intend to limit the user entered word length to six letters or less,
to allow for a maximum of 6 possible incorrect guesses (head, body, two arms, two legs).
  - If I have enough leftover time after creating that intital basic hangman game,
I may try to include extra incorrect guesses (such as face, hat, shoes, or hands) or longer word lengths.

4) Initial UML class diagrams

5) Plan and estimate of effort
  - I plan to work on this project step by step as I learn more,
and I will slowly build it over the next two months.
  - I am choosing to do this project individually,
so I will be the only person contributing to the effort.
