# Project_Lacovic
1)
- Project name: Basic Hangman Game
- Name: Gwen Lacovic

2) Describe project:
  - I am trying to build a basic hangman game that will (with the use of a GUI) display the number of incorrect guesses, guessed letters, and a stickman figure that has an added part after each incorrect guess.
  - I chose this project type because it interested me most on the example list, and I started thinking of what potential ways the game could be set up or look like. This game will be useful by being simple and fun for the player.
  - I intend to make there be a maximum of 6 possible incorrect guesses (head, body, two arms, two legs).
  - I will make it so there is either a randomly chosen six-letter word for the game, or that the player will have the ability to enter their own 4 to 8 letter long word. This option will be based on whether the player chooses a single player or multiplayer game at the start.

3) Initial UML class diagrams:

4) Plan and estimate of effort:
  - I plan to work on this project step by step as I learn more,
and I will slowly build it over the next two months.
  - I am choosing to do this project individually,
so I will be the only person contributing to the effort.
