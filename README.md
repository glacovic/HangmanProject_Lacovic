# Project_Lacovic
1)
- Project name: Basic Hangman Game
- Team name: Super Stickman
- Name: Gwen Lacovic

2) Describe project:
  - I am trying to build a basic hangman game that will display
a stickman figure, the number of incorrect guesses, and guessed letters with the use of a GUI.
  - I chose this project type because it interested me most on the example list, 
and I started thinking of what potential ways the game could be set up or look like.
  - I intend to limit the word length to six letters max,
to allow for a maximum of 6 possible incorrect guesses (head, body, two arms, two legs).
  - I will either make there be a randomly generated 6 letter word, allow the user to enter their own word, or try to make it so both options are possible for the game.

3) Initial UML class diagrams:

4) Plan and estimate of effort:
  - I plan to work on this project step by step as I learn more,
and I will slowly build it over the next two months.
  - I am choosing to do this project individually,
so I will be the only person contributing to the effort.
